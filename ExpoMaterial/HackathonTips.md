# Hackathon Tips

## 1. Brief

### 1.1 Core targets

1.  **Innovative and valuable idea ** => **explain** it. 
2. **Ability to realize** => **illustrate** it.



### 1.2 Meet the Criteria (As in material)

We have three phases:

| Phase   | Time     |
| ------- | -------- |
| PreHack | 4 days   |
| Hack    | 36 hours |
| Expo    | 2 hours  |

We need to accomplish following criteria:

| Criterion                | Session 70% | Session 25% |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Innovation               | PreHack     | Expo        |
| Feasibility              | PreHack     | Hack        |
| User Experience          | PreHack     | Hack        |
| UseOfData&Tech           | Hack        | Expo        |
| Alignment With Challenge | Hack        | Expo        |



### 1.3 Analyse

**Innovation**

No matter what topics it eventually come out with, we can expect the outstanding projects backs from AI or Blockchain (Or hardware related but that's out of our scope). Since it's hard to figure out something new from old techs.

**Feasibility**

We need to prove the feasibility, but not to implement them all. Nobody gonna check your code in Expo.

**User Experience**

One of the most important parts. First impression. 

**UseOfData&Tech**, **Alignment With Challenge**

That's what we need to reflect quickly during hacking.



### 1.4 Progress

Roles:

| Component  | Role                                                        |           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Blockchain | The innovation part (Asymmentropy/DID)                      | Kris      |
| iOS/Client | RPC client to connect with the Chain                        | Zhenjiang |
| BigData    | Analysis the data to assist the neccessity of our solution. | Yang      |
| PPT        | demo the idea and tech                                      | Daniel    |
|            |                                                             |           |



#### PreHack

We already have two ideas on Blockchain. 

1. Homepage:
   1. Idea Explaination: Chart, graph, animations, comparison. 
   2. Nice look
   3. Placeholder for Challenge alignment.
2. Blockchain DAPP:
   1. Blockchain privatenet buildup. 
   2. Smart Contract done. 
   3. RPC test done.
   4. Allow mobile app connection.
3. iOS app:
   1. Basic layout and PoC done
   2. Connection with RPC to blockchain node done.
   3. Interface to invoke fake accounts.
   4. Placeholder for Challenge alignment.
4. Big Data:
   1. Get possible dev tools ready. Get visualization solutions ready.
   2. Get template ready if available. 
5. Presentation:
   1. Get Charts and diagrams in ppt to explain the tech part ready.
   2. Leave the placeholder for Challenge alignment.
6. Misc:
   1. 



#### Hacking

1. Use maximum two hours to choose the topic and decide the tactic to align on each component.
2. If it's impossible to adopt to the challenges, go choose the arbitrary one (*The Future of Connected Communities*). 
3. Yang works on BigData part to support the neccessity of the idea.  
4. Each component start working on aligment. 
5. Max go talk with the mentors, explain them the idea, and get feekback.



#### Expo
